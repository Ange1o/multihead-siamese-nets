# Siamese Deep Neural Networks for semantic similarity. 
This repository contains implementation of Siamese Neural Networks in Tensorflow built based on 3 different and major deep learning architectures:
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Multihead Attention Networks

The main reason of creating this repository is to compare well-known implementaions of Siamese Neural Networks available on GitHub mainly built upon CNN and RNN architectures with Siamese Neural Network built based on multihead attention layers originally proposed in Transformer model from [Attention is all you need](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf) paper.
